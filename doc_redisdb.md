## RedisDB Summary Documentation

RedisDB is a Redis-based database package in Golang that aims to provide a concise, type-safe, and automated way to interact with Redis.

### Key Features

- **Type Safety:** RedisDB uses generics to specify key and value types, ensuring that your data is handled correctly.
- **Automatic Serialization:** Data is automatically serialized using the `msgpack` library, eliminating the need for manual marshaling and unmarshaling.
- **Modifiers and Data Validation:** Supports modifiers for fields in your structs, allowing for tasks like trimming spaces, converting to lowercase, setting default values, etc., during serialization and deserialization.
- **Documentation Generation:** Automatically generates documentation for your data structures, making it easier to understand and use them in your application.

### Getting Started

Before using RedisDB, ensure that you have Redis installed and running. Additionally, install the necessary Go dependencies.

To get started with RedisDB, you can use the following command:

```bash

go get github.com/doptime/redisdb
```

### Documentation Links

For detailed documentation on each data structure type, refer to the respective documentation files:

- [HashKey Documentation](doc_hashkey.md)
- [ListKey Documentation](doc_listKey.md)
- [SetKey Documentation](doc_setkey.md)
- [StringKey Documentation](doc_stringkey.md)
- [ZSetKey Documentation](doc_zsetkey.md)

### Error Handling

Most methods in RedisDB return errors that you should check to handle failures gracefully. Always ensure to handle errors to maintain the robustness of your application.

### Conclusion

RedisDB provides a robust and type-safe way to interact with Redis in Go. By using generics and automatic serialization, it reduces the complexity and potential errors in your code. Explore the various data structures and their methods to fully leverage the capabilities of Redis in your applications.
